# This Klebsiella pneumoniae assembly seems to have a lot of E. coli sequence
# in it. Interestingly, the change seems to happen within a contig, implying
# that it might be a hybrid (instead of contamination).

# This Klebsiella pneumoniae assembly has some K. quasipneumoniae sequence

# This Klebsiella variicola assembly has some Klebsiella Kp5 sequence in short
# contigs, so probably contamination.

# This Raoultella ornithinolytica assembly is a hybrid with R. planticola.

# This E. coli assembly has a couple of contig which look like they are from
# R. planticola. Perhaps a plasmid?
